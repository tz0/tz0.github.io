I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the College of William & Mary, under the supervision of [Prof. Dmitry Evtyushkin](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~dmitry/). My research interest falls in computer security and adjacent areas, specifically in micro-architectural support for security, hardware attacks and countermeasures, and secure branch predictions. 
Before coming to W&M, I received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Central Michigan University, where I researched in unsupervised machine learning, link anomaly detection, and cyber security visualization, under the supervision of [Prof. Qi Liao](http://people.cst.cmich.edu/liao1q/).
